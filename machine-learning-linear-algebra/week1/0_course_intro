# Introduction

You will learn how to translate Practical Scenarios into real world applications using Linear Algebra.

In the first week you will learn System of equations and identify and the matrices, will learn concepts like Singularity and Linear independence.

You will learn how to calculate determinant and learn how to do operations on matrices.

By week 2 you will be comfortable solving 2x2 and 3x3 system of equations and learn about Rank of a Matrix.

In week 3 we will learn about vectors. How vectors can be transformed.

In week 4 you will learn about eigen values and eigen vectors.
