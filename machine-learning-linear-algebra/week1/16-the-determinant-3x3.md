# The determinant (3x3)

From the previous quiz you may be noticing that for many matrices, it is not easy to tell if the rows are linearly dependent or independent, especially as matrices get bigger and bigger. The good news is that just like you saw for two by two matrix, there is a shortcut to tell if a matrix is singular or non singular, namely if the rows are linearly dependent or independent, and that is again the determinant. Recall that for two by two matrix, the determinant is the product of the numbers in the main diagonal minus the product of the numbers in the anti diagonal.



## Diagonals in 3x3 matrix

The determinant for three by three matrix is a bit more complicated than that for two by two matrix, but it is mostly the same.

Here it is, before calculating the determinant, recall that for a two by two matrix, you consider the main diagonals, add the product of the elements in one of them and subtract the product of the elements in the other one. In a three by three matrix a similar thing happens, except you will need some more diagonals. The first diagonal is the main one over here.

Now, consider the next diagonal here, let's try to draw it.

Well, this one is incomplete, so you can complete it by wrapping around the matrix and finishing it like this.

And the same thing happens with the next diagonal.

We've ran out of space here and wrap around and continue it.
